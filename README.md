## 💻 How to Run the Program

### 1. **Compile the code:**

Using GCC (Linux/Windows):
```bash
gcc converter.c -o converter
```
**Note: On Windows, make sure to run the terminal or Command Prompt where GCC is available (like MinGW or Code::Blocks).**


## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- **Switch statements**  
- **While loops**  
- **Integer arithmetic**  
- **Character arrays** (for hexadecimal digits)  
- **Data type handling** (`int`, `long`, `char`)  
- **Menu-driven interface** using `system("cls")` and `system("pause")`
``

## 🖥️ Sample Output
